The prince should grab the button and the button should be pressed.
To pass the test: #define USE_JUMP_GRAB in config.h and enable Settings -> Gameplay -> Enable jump grab.
(For some reason, the latter is not enabled by the replay, even though I recorded with the setting enabled. 
You need to enable it manually right after the playback starts.)
(UPDATE: Enabled this option in the playback file.)
