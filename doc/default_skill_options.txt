; The following customization options can be used for guard skills:
; strikeprob = Probability of striking, from 0 to 255.
; restrikeprob = Probability of re-striking after block, from 0 to 255.
; blockprob = Probability of blocking, from 0 to 255.
; impblockprob = Probability of improper blocking, from 0 to 255.
; advprob = Probability of going into hit range, from 0 to 255.
; refractimer = Refractory period after pain, in frames.
; extrastrength = Extra hit points.
